    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello! My name is <strong>[Your Name]</strong>, and I am a <strong>[your position]</strong> from Colombia. Currently, I am actively involved in research focused on cosmology, with particular interest in the large-scale structure of the universe, dark matter, and cosmic inflation. My work involves using advanced data analysis tools such as CosmoSIS, CAMB, and Cobaya to explore extensions of the standard cosmological model (ΛCDM).</p>
    
    <p>I have had the opportunity to work alongside amazing researchers in the field, including my mentors at <strong>[your institution]</strong>. Through collaborations with projects like <strong>[e.g., LSST or DESC]</strong>, I aim to contribute to the ongoing efforts to understand the underlying physics that shape our universe.</p>
    
    <p>Some key aspects of my work include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Exploring cosmological tensions, such as the H₀ tension and lensing anomalies.</li>
        <li>Utilizing computational tools for parameter estimation and cosmological simulations.</li>
        <li>Developing insights into how future surveys, such as LSST, can improve our understanding of cosmological parameters.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>In addition to my research, I am passionate about teaching and scientific outreach. I enjoy contributing to open-source projects, collaborating with fellow scientists, and mentoring students who are interested in entering the field of astrophysics.</p>
